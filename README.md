# Compress images with Gulp 3
### Fallow theses steps:

1. you need to have Node install to your computer, [the link ](https://nodejs.org/en/);

2. Intall gulp globally so that you can access it wherever you want  [the link](https://gulpjs.com/);

3. you need also Gitbash (command line), choose one:( Windows, Mac, linux)  [the link](https://git-scm.com/downloads);

4. in order to get it work, download the project folder wherever you want(ex:desktop) and open gitbash command  line,
   to select you folder (cd yourfolder),
   just type on the command line "npm i" or "npm install", node will look the package Json and install all your plugins on the fly 
     and the node modules;
     
5. the gulpfile.js is also an important file that requires the plugins in order to proceed for our images compression .
   i put the destination folder as dist, but you don't even need it, because the plugin will create it for us and put it where  we mentionned 
   it in gulpfile.js. I put it the see the compression result.
 
 6. in the command line (Gitbash) just type "gulp", this command will process our images for compression.
